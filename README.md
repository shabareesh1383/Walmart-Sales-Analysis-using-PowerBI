# Walmart-Sales-Analysis-using-PowerBI
##  Project Overview  
This project analyzes **Walmart's sales data** using **Power BI** to uncover trends, patterns, and business insights. The dataset includes weekly sales across multiple stores, economic indicators, and seasonal effects. Through interactive dashboards, this analysis helps understand the factors influencing Walmart‚Äôs revenue.

##  Dataset Description  
The dataset consists of **6,435 rows** and contains the following key columns:  
- **Store**: Store ID where the sales occurred.  
- **Date**: The weekly sales date.  
- **Weekly_Sales**: Total sales revenue for that store and week.  
- **Holiday_Flag**: 1 = Holiday Week, 0 = Non-Holiday Week.  
- **Temperature**: Average temperature recorded during the week.  
- **Fuel_Price**: The price of fuel, which could influence shopping behavior.  
- **CPI (Consumer Price Index)**: A measure of inflation affecting product prices.  
- **Unemployment**: The unemployment rate, which can impact consumer spending.  

---

##  Project Objectives  
- Analyze **weekly sales trends** and identify seasonal patterns.  
- Examine the impact of **holidays, fuel prices, inflation, and unemployment** on sales.  
- Compare **store-wise performance** and detect high-revenue stores.  
- Provide **data-driven insights** for inventory planning and business strategies.

## üõ† Methodology  
1. **Data Cleaning & Transformation:**  
   - Converted **dates into 'YYYY-MM' format** for better time-series analysis.  
   - Created **calculated columns** for monthly sales aggregation.  

2. **Dashboard & Visualizations in Power BI:**  
   - **Trend Analysis:** Sales trends over time, highlighting holiday spikes.  
   - **Economic Impact:** Correlation of sales with CPI, fuel prices, and unemployment.  
   - **Store Performance:** Identifying top and bottom-performing stores.  
   - **Seasonal Analysis:** Understanding shopping behavior during holidays.  

---

##  Key Insights  
 **Holiday weeks** show **significantly higher sales**, emphasizing the need for seasonal promotions.  
 **Sales dip post-holiday**, suggesting opportunities for discount-driven campaigns.  
 **Higher fuel prices** slightly reduce in-store visits, making a case for online promotions.  
 **Inflation (CPI) fluctuations** affect consumer spending but do not drastically impact Walmart due to its affordability.  
 **Extreme weather conditions** impact foot traffic, requiring location-based inventory adjustments.
